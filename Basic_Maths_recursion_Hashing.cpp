//Extracting a digit 
// The modulus operator % computes the remainder when a number is divided by another number. When we perform N % 10 we get the last digit of the number N.
// Eg. N = 7789, then N%10 results in 9 which is the last digit.
// After extracting the last digit we need to remove the last digit as well which can be done via division operator.
// Eg. N = 7789 then N/10 results in 778, removing the last digit.
